#Weapon Champion
Weapon Champion		KEY:Fighter Archetype ~ Weapon Champion			CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype.FighterArchetype.FighterHeavyArmorProficiency.FighterBravery.FighterWeaponTraining_ALL.FighterArmorTraining_ALL.FighterArmorMastery		DESC:The weapon champion is a combatant who focuses all her skill and determination on being the absolute best with a weapon in hand. Though she may prefer a single, specific weapon, every weapon champion has trained extensively enough to be more than merely proficient with all weapons similar in use or training to her preferred instrument of death. Weapon champions often arise from the ranks of professional warriors and are most common among knights, gladiators, mercenaries, and duelists, though anyone with the dedication and resources to spend time and effort on long hours of training can join their number. Some monastic sects encourage their members to become weapon champions as a form of self-improvement, and some gods of battle have weapon champions among their clerics.
